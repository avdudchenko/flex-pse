"""Canonical energy-variable names for flex-pse.

Every unit model registers at least one power draw through
:meth:`flexops.core.ops_block.OpsBlockData.register_power`, using one of the
power names defined here. Both are **powers in kW** despite the domain word
"energy": :data:`POWER_ELECTRICAL` is a unit's electrical draw and
:data:`POWER_THERMAL` its heat duty (at a registered temperature). FlexCosting
aggregates them into per-carrier kW time series and hands the electrical one to
EECO, which derives kWh internally from the time step.

**Fuel is not a power.** A combustible fuel is metered and billed on **volume**,
so a unit that burns fuel registers its :data:`FUEL_USAGE` flow — a volumetric
rate in m³/hr — through
:meth:`flexops.core.ops_block.OpsBlockData.register_fuel_usage`, and FlexCosting
hands that volume series to EECO. flex-pse assumes **no** heating value anywhere;
if a tariff prices gas on an energy basis, converting it is EECO's job (it
applies its own fuel heating-value assumption).

The names live here as constants so a typo becomes an import error rather than a
silently-unaggregated variable. Do not hand-type the string values anywhere
else, and never introduce a variable named bare ``power``, ``energy``, or
``work``.
