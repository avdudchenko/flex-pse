# The frozen flex-pse public API, verbatim from PLAN.md §2.
#
# BREAKING-CHANGE TRIPWIRE. From milestone M09 on, any pull request that has to
# edit this file to keep src/flexops/tests/test_api_freeze.py green is making a
# breaking change and must say so in its description. Do not "improve" it.
#
# The same tripwire covers api_freeze_config.json, this script's config-driven
# twin: it must keep describing the same model, and the test holds the two to
# the same solved objective. That notice lives here because JSON has no comment
# syntax and the config schema forbids undocumented keys.
#
# It runs with the working directory set to where its data fixtures live
# (the sibling data/ directory), since it loads them by bare filename. Its arcs
# are not expanded here: applying pyo.TransformationFactory("network.expand_arcs")
# is the caller's explicit step, as is the solve.
