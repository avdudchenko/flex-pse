"""Bypass-stream constraints around a unit.

Smallest useful v0 form (documented choice): a fraction of a flow may bypass
the unit's energy relation entirely. Rewiring Ports/Arcs for a physical bypass
stream is explicitly out of scope for v0 -- this only introduces the
``treated_flow`` quantity a unit's own energy relation should consume in place
of the raw flow.

    Adds:

    * ``bypass_flow[t]`` -- Var, same units as ``flow_var``, bounded
      ``[0, bypass_max]``.
    * ``treated_flow[t]`` -- Var, same units as ``flow_var``; the quantity a

    Args:
        unit: The unit block to attach the bypass structure to.
        flow_var: The time-indexed flow ``Var`` being (partially) bypassed.
        bypass_max: Upper bound on ``bypass_flow[t]``, a units-carrying
