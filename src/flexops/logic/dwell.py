"""Optional UC piece: continuous set-point dwell.

Holds a **continuous** process variable (inlet flow, temperature, or any other
time-indexed Var) steady for a minimum duration -- unrelated to the binary
minimum-uptime/downtime logic in
:func:`~flexops.logic.unit_commitment.add_startup_shutdown`, which is a
separate, UC-specific concept. This is a fixed-grid piecewise-constant
constraint: the horizon is partitioned into blocks of ``k`` steps, and the
variable may only change value at block boundaries.

    """Hold a continuous, time-indexed Var constant within fixed ``k``-step blocks.

    The horizon is partitioned into blocks starting at ``t = 0, k, 2k, ...``;
    within each block every point is constrained equal to its predecessor, so
    the variable can only change value at a block boundary. The unit is taken
    from ``var.parent_block()`` (the block ``var`` is already attached to).

    Args:
        var: A continuous, time-indexed ``Var`` to hold steady within each
            block (e.g. an inlet flow or temperature set point).
        k: Block length in steps. Must be ``>= 1``.

        ``t`` that is not a block boundary. ``None`` if ``k == 1`` (every
