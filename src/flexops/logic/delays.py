"""Optional UC piece: startup/response delay tied to an upstream unit.

The single-hop primitive behind the chemical-stabilization delay *chains* of
Rao et al. 2024: a unit may not start (or be on) until ``k`` steps after an
upstream unit's status. Full chain templates composing several of these
single-hop primitives are planned future work but not yet implemented.

    """Tie ``unit``'s on/off status to an upstream unit's status, delayed by ``k``.

    ``unit`` may be on at ``t`` only if ``upstream`` was on continuously
    across the trailing window ``[t - k, t]`` -- one condition that covers
    both the ``k``-step delay and "upstream off implies downstream off".
    Disaggregated over each lag in that window (``unit.status[t] <=
    upstream.status[t - lag]`` for every ``lag`` in ``0..k``) rather than an
    aggregate sum, because it is tighter under the LP relaxation used by
    :func:`~flexops.logic.status.relax`.

    Args:
        unit: The downstream unit block; must already carry a ``status`` Var
            (via :func:`~flexops.logic.status.add_status`).
        upstream: The upstream unit block whose ``status`` Var gates ``unit``.
        k: Number of steps the downstream start is delayed behind the upstream.
        initially_on: How to handle a window that reaches before ``t = 0``.
            If ``True`` (default), the window clamps to ``[max(t - k, 0), t]``
            -- a unit already running at ``t = 0`` counts as warmed up, the
            right convention for a standalone horizon. If ``False``, the
            window is only checked for ``t >= k`` and ``unit.status[t] == 0``
            is forced for ``t < k`` instead -- the right convention for a
            rolling-horizon window with no assumed prior state.

    Registers ``unit``'s ``status`` Var as rolling-horizon state (trailing
    ``k`` steps) via ``flexops.logic.status._register_rolling_state`` --
    consuming that registry is the rolling-horizon scheduler's job, not built
    here.

    Returns:
        The attached ``startup_delay`` Constraint.

    Raises:
        FlexConfigError: If ``upstream`` has no ``status`` Var.
