"""Optional UC piece: transition + minimum uptime/downtime logic.

Ties a ``startup[t]``/``shutdown[t]`` binary pair to the rising/falling edges of
a unit's ``status[t]`` binary, and (optionally) enforces a minimum number of
steps the unit must stay up/down once it transitions -- the Rajan-Takriti
rolling-sum formulation. A unit's ``unit_commitment`` config enables this only
when transition bookkeeping (e.g. startup cost, startup-delay chains) or
minimum dwell-time enforcement is needed.

Note: this "minimum uptime/downtime" is a UC-modeling concept (how long a
status must hold once it changes) and is unrelated to the continuous-variable
:func:`~flexops.logic.dwell.add_dwell` (holding a process variable like flow or
temperature steady) -- the two share no code and are conceptually orthogonal.

    """Attach ``startup[t]``/``shutdown[t]`` binaries and transition logic.

    For each ``t >= 1``, adds:

    * ``transition[t]``: ``status_var[t] - status_var[t-1] == startup[t] -
      shutdown[t]``.
    * ``min_uptime[t]``: ``sum(startup[i] for i in window) <= status_var[t]``,
      window ``= range(max(1, t - min_uptime + 1), t + 1)``. A startup within
      the trailing ``min_uptime`` steps forces the unit on at ``t``.
    * ``min_downtime[t]``: the mirror, ``sum(shutdown[i] for i in window) <=
      1 - status_var[t]``, window sized by ``min_downtime``.

    At the defaults (``min_uptime=1, min_downtime=1``) each window is the
    single point ``{t}``, so these reduce exactly to the tightening bounds
    ``startup[t] <= status_var[t]`` and ``shutdown[t] <= 1 - status_var[t]``.
    Summing those two implies ``startup[t] + shutdown[t] <= 1`` directly (even
    under a continuous relaxation of ``startup``/``shutdown``), so no separate
    exclusivity constraint is needed.

    No horizon-end truncation is needed -- each window's upper bound is always
    ``t``, which is always in range; only the lower bound is clamped to 1.

    ``t = 0`` is left unconstrained in v0: there is no initial-status Param to
    reference a transition *into* the horizon's first point.

    Args:
        unit: The unit block to attach the transition structure to.
        status_var: The unit's time-indexed on/off ``status`` Binary (from
            :func:`~flexops.logic.status.add_status`).
        min_uptime: Minimum number of steps the unit must stay on after a
            startup. Must be ``>= 1``; ``1`` means no additional requirement
            beyond the instant the unit turns on.
        min_downtime: Minimum number of steps the unit must stay off after a
            shutdown. Must be ``>= 1``, with the same "no-op at 1" meaning.

    Returns:
        The attached ``(startup, shutdown)`` Binary Vars, each indexed over
        ``t >= 1``.

    Raises:
        FlexConfigError: If ``min_uptime`` or ``min_downtime`` is ``< 1``.
