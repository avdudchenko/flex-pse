r"""GenericRenewables(OpsBlockData): capacity_factor-driven electrical export (§3.4).

Like :class:`~flexops.unit_models.powergeneration.combustor.Combustor` and
:class:`~flexops.unit_models.storage.battery.BatteryModel`, this unit has no
fluid ports (no ``property_package``): it turns an exogenous production
profile -- solar irradiance, a wind-speed-derived output curve, or any other
precomputed capacity-factor series -- into an electrical export, scaled by a
fixable nameplate ``capacity``:

.. math::

    P_{gen}[t] = \text{capacity\_factor}[t] \cdot \text{capacity}

    P_{elec}[t] = -P_{gen}[t]

Like a discharging :class:`BatteryModel` or an exporting :class:`Combustor`,
the draw is **negative** (export): ``power_electrical[t]`` is upper-bounded at
0, so plant aggregation (a plain sum) nets generation against load with no
per-unit sign flipping.

The sign is a **separate constraint** from the relation, exactly as
:class:`~flexops.unit_models.powergeneration.combustor.Combustor` splits them.
``power_generated[t]`` holds the non-negative generation magnitude and is the
registered relation's target; ``power_electrical_sign[t]`` negates it into the
draw and is deliberately never registered, so no surrogate swap can replace it
(see :meth:`~flexops.core.ops_block.OpsBlockData.register_relation`). Nothing
can prove an arbitrary swapped-in surrogate body is non-positive over the
feasible region, so the export convention rests on the target's own lower
bound of 0 instead: a fitted relationship predicting a negative export
violates a bound naming the quantity it got wrong, rather than silently
conflicting with ``power_electrical``'s upper bound. That also means a
surrogate for this unit is fitted in generation-magnitude space -- positive,
the convention generation data is normally logged in -- which is why
``power_generated`` rather than ``power_electrical`` is the registered IO
output.

``capacity_factor`` accepts exactly two forms, checked once the model's
:class:`~flexops.core.time_block.TimeBlockData` (and hence its horizon length)
is known, in ``build()``:

* An **array-like** of length ``T`` (list/tuple/``numpy.ndarray``/
  ``pandas.Series``) -- copied into a plain per-timestep list at construction.
* A **time-indexed Pyomo Var/Param** of length ``T``, living anywhere on the
  model (e.g. an upstream irradiance/wind-profile signal) -- kept as a live
  symbolic reference, so a later change to that component's value changes
  ``power_electrical`` with no rebuild.

A scalar value (a bare number, or an unindexed Pyomo component) is rejected:
the whole point of this unit is a timeseries, not a broadcast constant.
``capacity_factor`` is deliberately **not** IO-registered: like
``FlexCosting``'s ``energy_prices``, it is exogenous data feeding an
expression, not a decision Var this unit owns.

Every value must lie in **[0, 1]** -- a capacity factor is a fraction of
nameplate: below 0 would make the unit a load, above 1 would export more than
the capacity the plant is sized and costed for. An array-like is checked
entrywise; a live Pyomo reference is checked at construction over the values
it carries then (an uninitialized member is skipped, and holding a later
assignment in range is that component's own bounds' job, not this unit's).

``technology`` (``"solar"``/``"wind"``/``None``) is a **placeholder**: it is
stored on the config and nowhere else consumed by this unit's own build
logic. It is reserved for a future costing-function selection (different
technology-specific capex/opex parameter sets), not yet implemented.
