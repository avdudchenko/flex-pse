"""SISOBlock: the single-inlet/single-outlet IO-topology base.

The first of the IO-topology base classes: owns port construction (via the
inherited :meth:`~flexops.core.ops_block.OpsBlockData.add_stream_ports`) and
the per-stream mass balance, so physical subclasses
(:class:`~flexops.unit_models.pump.Pump`,
:class:`~flexops.unit_models.storage.tank.Tank`) only add the
flow<->energy relationship (or, when their flows genuinely differ, replace
the mass balance -- see :meth:`SISOBlockData._build_mass_balance`). Registers
no power itself; a bare ``SISOBlock`` declares neither ``power_electrical``
nor ``power_thermal``.

The pass-through balance is built via the inherited
:meth:`~flexops.core.ops_block.OpsBlockData.add_pass_through_constraints`: every
state variable the inlet/outlet ports expose (flow included) flows straight
through. ``SISOBlock`` overrides the base ``allow_pass_through`` default to
``True`` so the topology is well-posed (DoF == 0) out of the box; pass
``allow_pass_through=False`` to leave the state variables unlinked and wire a
custom relationship instead.
