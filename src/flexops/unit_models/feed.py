r"""Feed(OpsBlockData): a boundary source with no inlets and N named outlets.

This models the supply side of the facility. A ``Feed`` represents a stream
entering the plant from outside: it carries the stream's state (composition,
pressure, temperature — whatever the property package tracks), measures the
**total** amount of resource crossing the boundary, limits that withdrawal
over time if configured to, and can optionally add its cost to opex.

The number of outlets is a config option, so ``Feed`` can't reuse one of the
fixed-inlet/fixed-outlet base classes — it subclasses
:class:`~flexops.core.ops_block.OpsBlockData` directly and builds its own
ports and balance equation, the same way
:class:`~flexops.unit_models.splitter.Splitter` does.

The metered withdrawal is just the sum of the flow leaving through every
outlet:

.. math::

    \dot{W}[t] = \sum_i \dot{V}_{out,i}[t]

A feed uses no energy: it declares neither ``power_electrical`` nor
``power_thermal``, and doesn't register any power use.

**One block, one resource.** ``resource_name`` is the key that the
surrounding :class:`~flexops.core.plant_block.PlantBlockData` groups blocks
under when it adds up ``total_feed``. This name doesn't have to match the
Pyomo block's own name: two ``Feed`` blocks with different resource names
show up as two separate rows in ``total_feed``, while two blocks that share a
resource name get summed into one row — this is how you'd model the same
resource entering the plant at two different points. If a plant brings in
several different resources, use one ``Feed`` block per resource, not one
block that tracks several resources at once.

Everything about the stream other than flow — its composition, pressure,
temperature — is treated as the boundary condition. That condition is set on
the **reference** outlet (the first name in ``outlet_names``), and every
other outlet is forced to match it: there's one source, so there's one
condition.

    r"""A boundary source: no inlets, N named outlets, one metered withdrawal.

    See the module docstring above for the balance equation, how outlet
    states are handled, and why ``resource_name`` doesn't have to match the
    block name. ``outlet_names`` decides how many outlets there are and what
    their port names will be (``f"outlet_{name}"``). The first name in the
    list is the reference outlet, which carries the boundary conditions.

    Config:
        ``property_package`` (inherited): a single-phase package shared by
        every port.

        ``outlet_names`` (default ``("a",)``): the outlets' names, used as
        their port names. Names must be unique and non-empty.

        ``resource_name`` (default ``None``): the key this block's
        withdrawal is grouped under. Defaults to the block's own Pyomo name.

        ``min_withdrawal`` / ``max_withdrawal`` (default ``None``): scalar
        limits on the withdrawal, with units. Interpreted according to
        ``withdrawal_basis`` (default ``LimitBasis.PERIOD``) as either a
        rate that must hold every period, or a total amount over the whole
        horizon.

        ``price`` (default ``None``): a flat price per unit withdrawn,
        billed through ``costing_package`` (inherited) — which must be set
        if you use this.

    Example:
        >>> from flexops.testing import dummy_time_block
        >>> from flexops.unit_models import Feed
        >>> m = dummy_time_block(3)
        >>> m.raw_water = Feed(  # doctest: +SKIP
