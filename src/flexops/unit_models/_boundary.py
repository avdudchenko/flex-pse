"""Shared helper code used by the boundary blocks.

:class:`~flexops.unit_models.feed.Feed` and
:class:`~flexops.unit_models.product.Product` both put a limit on a
time-indexed amount — a withdrawal that must stay under a supply limit, or a
delivery that must stay under a demand limit. Both need the same pieces: a
mutable limit ``Param`` and the ``Constraint`` that enforces it.

There are two ways to set a limit, and they mean different things — not just
two names for the same rule. On the **period** basis
(:func:`add_time_limits`) the limit is a *rate* that must hold in every
single period, like a permitted withdrawal rate or a pump's maximum
throughput. On the **horizon** basis (:func:`add_horizon_limits`) the limit
is a *total amount* over the whole time horizon, like a monthly permit or a
take-or-pay delivery contract, and the optimizer is free to choose how that
total gets spread out over time. A period limit is stricter than a horizon
limit (satisfying the first also satisfies the second), so the caller must
say which one is meant using :class:`LimitBasis`. flex-pse never guesses
this from the units, though it does check that the units match.

The limits are mutable ``Param``\\ s, not ``Var.setlb``/``setub``, for three
reasons: ``set_value`` is the approved way to update a value in place;
Params keep working even after
:meth:`~flexops.core.ops_block.OpsBlockData.set_external_dispatch` fixes the
bounded ``Var``; and the ``Constraint`` that references the ``Param`` carries
a dual, so after solving you can read the shadow price of a resource limit.

    The total is a ``Var`` defined by an equality, not a plain

    The total uses ``upper``'s units if an upper limit is given, and
    ``lower``'s units otherwise — so a limit given in litres is reported
