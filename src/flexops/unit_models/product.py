r"""Product(OpsBlockData): a boundary sink with N named inlets and no outlets.

This is the mirror image of :class:`~flexops.unit_models.feed.Feed`, and it
models the delivery side of the facility. A ``Product`` adds up everything
arriving through its inlets, can limit that delivery over time, and can
optionally price it — a positive price is a cost (like paying to dispose of
brine), while a negative price is revenue (like selling potable water).

The number of inlets is a config option, so ``Product`` can't reuse one of
the fixed-inlet/fixed-outlet base classes — it subclasses
:class:`~flexops.core.ops_block.OpsBlockData` directly and builds its own
ports and balance equation.

.. math::

    \dot{D}[t] = \sum_i \dot{V}_{in,i}[t]

A product uses no energy: it declares neither ``power_electrical`` nor
``power_thermal``, and doesn't register any power use.

Two things are deliberately different from ``Feed``:

**It doesn't blend.** Each inlet's state (other than flow) comes from
whatever's connected upstream and is left as-is — there's no constraint
tying the inlets' states together. A ``Product`` only adds up *flow*.
Blending composition, temperature, or pressure together is
:class:`~flexops.unit_models.mixer.Mixer`'s job, and that blending math is
bilinear (harder for the solver). If you want one blended stream, put a
``Mixer`` upstream of the ``Product``.

**Limits on composition are set per inlet.** If you want to limit something
about what arrives (like pressure), you limit one specific inlet's state —
there's no blended stream to limit::

    from flexops.unit_models._boundary import add_time_limits

    add_time_limits(
        product, product.inlet_a_state.pressure, "inlet_a_pressure",
        upper=200000 * pyunits.Pa,
    )

**One block, one resource.** ``resource_name`` is the key that the
surrounding :class:`~flexops.core.plant_block.PlantBlockData` groups blocks
under when it adds up ``total_product``. This doesn't have to match the
Pyomo block's own name: two ``Product`` blocks with different resource names
show up as two separate rows in ``total_product``, while two blocks sharing a
resource name get summed into one row.

    r"""A boundary sink: N named inlets, no outlets, one delivery total.

    See the module docstring above for the balance equation and the two
    deliberate differences from :class:`~flexops.unit_models.feed.Feed`: no
    blending, and composition limits set per inlet. ``inlet_names`` decides
    how many inlets there are and what their port names will be
    (``f"inlet_{name}"``).

    Config:
        ``property_package`` (inherited): a single-phase package shared by
        every port.

        ``inlet_names`` (default ``("a",)``): the inlets' names, used as
        their port names. Names must be unique and non-empty.

        ``resource_name`` (default ``None``): the key this block's delivery
        is grouped under. Defaults to the block's own Pyomo name.

        ``min_demand`` / ``max_demand`` (default ``None``): scalar limits on
        the delivery, with units. Interpreted according to ``demand_basis``
        (default ``LimitBasis.PERIOD``) as either a rate that must hold
        every period, or a total amount over the whole horizon.

        ``price`` (default ``None``): a flat price per unit delivered —
        positive is a cost, negative is revenue — billed through
        ``costing_package`` (inherited), which must be set if you use this.

    Example:
        >>> from flexops.testing import dummy_time_block
        >>> from flexops.unit_models import Product
        >>> m = dummy_time_block(3)
        >>> m.potable = Product(  # doctest: +SKIP
